- What is zero trust
	- Assumptions: 
		- Attacker is always present
		- No user or device is trusted
		- Every connection needs to verify the user, device and resource 
	- Principle of least privilege is essential to zero trust
- Zero trust maturity model (ZTMM) 
	- Five distinct pillars 
		- Identity
		- Devices
		- Network
		- Apps and workloads
		- Data
	- Each are built on three big pillars
		- Visibility and analysis
		- Automation and orchestration 
		- Governance 
	- Some pillars are easier to implement, some harder
		- Don't have to do everything all at once
	- Multiple stages of maturity
		- Traditional
		- Initial 
		- Advanced 
		- Optimal
	- Costs go up at each phase
- Important concepts
	- Not east to install zero trust
	- More of a journey and mindset
	- Incremental roll out
	- Can impact operations
- Applying zero trust in OT/SCADA
	- First: asset and device inventory
		- Map all network connectivity between all devices, users and systems
	- Micro segmentation: keep networks as small as possible
		- Have policy enforcement points (PEPs) between each network
		- Can be firewall or gateway device
	- Use MFA for all access
	- Data diodes (uni directional gateway) to transfer data from one net to another 
	- Collect logs and pass all logs to aggregator (SIEM)
		- Make sure defenders are trained to use SIEM
