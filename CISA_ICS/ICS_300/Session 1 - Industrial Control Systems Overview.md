- Basic industrial control systems
	- SCADA - supervisory control and data acquisition 
	- DCS - distributed control systems
	- PCS - process control systems
	- EMS - energy management systems
	- AS - automation system
	- SIS - safety instrumented system
- OT - operational technology.  Refers to the hardware and software of it
- Embedded system: computer consisting of hardware and software that typically does dedicated task
	- Typically part of another system
	- 98% of all microprocessors are part of embedded system
	- PLCs, networking, other random stuff that has a chip in it
- Hardware (x86, PowerPC, ARM, MIPS)
	- Memory: nonvolatile memory (flash and firmware)
		- Volatile: RAM, stacks, buffer, variables
	- Inputs and outputs, ports, user interface stuff
- Programs
	- real time operation systems, IEC 61131 program languages, etc
	- CoDeSys - tool that allows you to write in any language
	- Device drivers (ethernet, memory)
	- Services (web, ftp)
	- Debuggers
- Ladder logic motor walkthrough

	- A line of code is called a rung
	- PLC executes from left to right and top to bottom
	- Each completion of a program is called a scan
	- PLC can do many scans in a second (50 to 60 ms)
- Each rung executes on an IF -> THEN principle
- Connected Components Workbench can be used to demo PLCs
