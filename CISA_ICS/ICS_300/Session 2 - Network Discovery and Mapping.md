- Passive discovery
	- Uncover info without disrupting any of the normal network operations
	- Cautious and meticulous 
	- DOES NOT SEND ANY NETWORK PACKETS
- Passive discovery tools
	- ipconfig, netstat/net, iptables, WIRESHARK, crontab, files on machine
	- Check logs and cache
	- On Linux: `arp -a -i eth0 -n` to show arp table (obviously replace interface as needed)
	- https://macvendors.com/ to correlate MACs to manufacture
	- `ipconfig /all` want to check if IP routing enabled bc then you can use as pivot to internal networks, especially if machine has multiple interfaces 
	- `ifconfig -a` on Linux does the same as the windows one
	- `cat /etc/resolv.conf` to check DNS info on Linux machines
	- `netstat` is useful for finding connections to the host
		- Add `-anob -p` to Windows commands to see more ports and other info
		- On Linux, use `-pantu` 
	- Check browser history and recent tabs
		- `.bash_history` 
	- Check routing tables
		- `route -n` or `netstat -rn` for Linux
		- `route print` for Windows
	- tcpdump/windump to capture packets across the wire
- Active discovery
	- Generates noise and packets
		- These can break inflexible control systems
	- arp scan: sneds out packets querying for MAC address
	- nmap: DANGEROUS to run directly against IT, SCADA and PCS systems
		- Works by sending out specific packets and analyzing the results
		- SYN scan (-sS).  Need to be root
		- TCP connect (-sT).  Can run as user
		- ![](ICS_300/IMG/nmap.png)
		- Slow down scans to avoid IDS
			- T0 is slowest, T5 fastest
		- `--reason` flag shows why NMAP is returning the results it is claiming
		- 
	- Common Control Systems Port Numbers
