- Most cyber attacks are against government 
- Asset and information inventory is critical 
	- Need to know what you have, why and where it is, plus what it does
- Field devices
	- On the network but outside the physical parameter
	- Often do not have robust security built in
- GRASSMARLIN 
	- NSA tool that maps OT networks 
	- Totally passive tool
- Personnel devices and removable media are usually bad ideas 
- ICS network should be separated from IT net and commercial internet 
	- Should have logs and DMZ between them 
- Data diodes allow one connection one way 
- IDS: intrusion detection system 
	- Multiple types: host, network, application, digital, paper, anomalies 
- IPS: intrusion prevention system
	- Actively blocks and/or mitigates threats instead of just detecting then 
- Host IDS (HIDS)
	- Deployed on a single host
	- Centrally managed, sends logs to a server 
- Network IDS (NIDS)
	- Usually a network TAP, scans both sides of conversation 
- Netflow logs are used to detect traffic
	- Can then search on anomaly 
	- Look for scans, weird traffic, increased traffic, host to host comms
- Zeek
	- Open source IDS
	- Can query on specific traffic 
- Snort rules
	- Used in almost every IDS
	- Triggers on certain traffic patterns
	- Can use preprocessors to make the rules even easier to write
		- Useful for weird protocols used in OT
- IR phases
	- Preparation
	- Identification 
	- Containment
	- Clean up/recovery 
	- Follow up
